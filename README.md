In this homework my assignment was to make a password generator website. So first step was to create an html page. I added a title tag and named it Password Generator. Then I added an h1 tag and called it password generator. Then I added an h2 tag and named it Generate a Password. Then I created a div for the buttons. Then I made a generate password button and a copy to clipboard button. Then I used a css stylesheet to edit all the styles and fix the positioning of the content and the box. Then I went into js and started creating the actual functions for the password generator. First I made variables for enter, confirmNumber, confirmCharacter, confirmUppercase, and lowerCase. Then I gave the password variables values. Then I added an eventlistener to the click. Then I created a function for generate password and added prompts for all the questions needed to create the password. I then created a space varaiable to fill uppercase conversions. Then I started random selection for all varaiables using math.random. Finally I used a userinput function to get the password value in the textbox.
